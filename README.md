# Unit Test Examples

This repo contains examples for unit test course. Most of the examples are case-spesific. Therefore, there could be some
parts that you shouldn't use normally or better practises for these parts.

Some of the examples are taken from the book **"Unit Testing Principles, Practises and Patterns"** by Vladimir Khorikov.

There is also a [notest](https://github.com/OzelAhmet/unit-test/tree/notest) branch. Only difference is that the test files are removed.

### Running Tests

```sh
./gradlew test
```
command can be used to run tests. Java 21 is used, make sure `$JAVA_HOME` variable is set correctly to be used by Gradle.
