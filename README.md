# Unit Test Examples

This repo contains examples for unit test course. Most of the examples are case-spesific. Therefore, there could be some
parts that you shouldn't use normally or better practises for these parts.

Some of the examples are taken from the book **"Unit Testing Principles, Practises and Patterns"** by Vladimir Khorikov.
